## What is Canvas Script
Canvas Script is a JavaScript canvas tool that makes using the different functions in built in canvas easier. Canvas Script is also highly expansible and the code should be legible to anyone who knows basic JavaScript, so feel free to make your own branch of this or make a pull request to improve the existing code.

## How do i use Canvas Script
To use Canvas Script, all you need is a HTML file which looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <script src="canvasscript.js" defer></script>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"/> <!-- optional -->
    </head>
    <body></body>
</html>
```

then you can also include your own JavaScript file, also deffered and under the canvasscript.js include (otherwise strange things happen).
